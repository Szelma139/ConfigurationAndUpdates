It use aufs (by default, but could use another unionfs tool) to permit live session changes but in RAM by default, so everything is forgotten at reboot.

You could install them by running simply:

apt-get install fsprotect

Once done, from online doc:

    After that:

        Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst or /etc/default/grub2 or /etc/lilo.conf and add "fsprotect=1G" to kernel parameters.
        Modify 1G as needed.
        Apply changes (i.e. run update-grub)
        Edit /etc/default/fsprotect if you want to protect filesystems other than /.
        reboot

    You may also want to password protect the grub bootloader or forbid any changes to it.

From there, if some file is protected against changes, for sample by

chmod ugo-w myfile

if you use for sample vi myfile and try to write on it with command :w!, this will work and your myfile became changed. You may reboot in order to retrieve unmodified myfile.

That's not even possible with my following first solution:
